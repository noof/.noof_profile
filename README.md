# HOW TO USE

1. Change directory to your home directory.
..-`cd` or `cd ~`
2. Clone the project (make sure you don't already have a directory called 
`.noof_profile`, silly)
..-`git clone https://github.com/noof/.noof_profile.git`
3. Run the link script
..-`./link.sh`
..-If you already have your own dot files, delete them first.
4. You are good to go! Make any changes you want to customize it.

Got some cool tab stuff in there as well.

Also an ls alias in there for long listings.
